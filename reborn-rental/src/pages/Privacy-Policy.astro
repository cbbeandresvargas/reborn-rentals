    <p>
     This privacy policy discloses the privacy practices for (www.RebornRental.com).
     This privacy policy applies solely to information collected by this website.
     It will notify you of the following: 
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>What personally identifiable information is collected from you through the web site, how it is used and with whom it may be shared.</li>
        <li>What choices are available to you regarding the use of your data.</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>How We Use Personal Information</h2>
    <p>Most of the information we collect is provided by you on our order form,
        which is used for billing purposes and to fulfill your rental requests.
        If we have trouble processing an order, we’ll also use this information to contact you. 
        We may use or disclose the personal information we collect for one or more
        the following business purposes.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>To fulfill or meet the reason you provided the information. For example, to respond to inquiries about our products and services.</li>
        <li>To provide, support, personalize, and develop our website, products and services.</li>
        <li>To create, maintain, customize, and secure your account with us.</li>
        <li>To process your requests, purchases, transactions and payments and to prevent transactional fraud.</li>
        <li>To deliver content and product service offerings relevant to your interests, including targeted offers via email (with your consent where required by law).</li>
        <li>To help maintain the safety, security and integrity of our website, products, and services, databases and other technology assets, and businesses.</li>
        <li>To respond to law enforcement requests as required by applicable law, court order, or governmental regulations.</li>
        <li>As described to you when collecting your personal information or as otherwise set forth in the applicable laws.</li>
        <li>To evaluate or conduct a merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution, or other sale or transfer of
            some or all of RebornRental’s assets, in which personal information held by RebornRental, Inc. about our website users and customers is among the assets transferred.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Sharing Personal Information</h2>
    <p>RebornRental, Inc. may share your personal information with a third party for a business purpose, including without
        limitation advertising and marketing on our website and elsewhere based on users’ online activities over time and across
        different sites, services and devices. We also will share your personal information with third parties outside of
        our organization as necessary to fulfill your requests, e.g., to fulfill orders. </p>
    <p>
        We share your personal information with the following categories of third parties:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Service providers.</li>
      <li>Data aggregators.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>
        Examples of sharing personal information 
    </h2>
    <p>
        We use an outside shipping company to ship orders, and a credit card processing company to bill users for goods and services.
        These companies are not permitted to retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes beyond filling your order. 
        We partner with another party to provide specific services. When the user signs up for these services, we will share names, or other contact information
        that is necessary for the third party to provide these services. These parties are not allowed to use personally identifiable information except
        for the purpose of providing these services. 
        RebornRental does not share personal information with third parties for their own direct marketing purposes without your prior consent. 
    </p>

    <h2>Sale of personal information </h2>
    <p>We do not sell personal information to third parties.</p>

    <h2>Your Access to and Control Over Information</h2>
    <p>To exercise the rights described above, please submit a
        verifiable consumer request to us by either:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Calling phone number</li>
      <li>Emailing us at Support@RebornRental.com</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Only you, or a person that you authorize to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable
        consumer request related to your personal information. You may also make a verifiable
        consumer request on behalf of your minor child. 
        We will require an authorized representative making a request on your behalf to provide
        a valid power of attorney, the requester’s valid government issued identification, and
        the authorized agent’s valid government issued identification. 
        You may only make a verifiable consumer request twice in a 12-month period. The consumer request must: 
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about
        whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative.</li>
      <li>Describe your request with sufficient detail to allow us to properly understand, evaluate,and respond to it.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        While you are not required to create an account with us to make a request, we do consider requests made through your
        password protected account sufficiently verified when the request relates to personal information about that specific account.
        We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within forty-five (45) days of its receipt. If we require
        more time (up to 90 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing. 
        Any response we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding our receipt of the verifiable consumer request.
        If applicable, the response will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request. For data portability requests,
        we will select a format to provide you personal information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the
        information from one entity to another without hindrance. 
        If you choose to exercise your rights, we won’t deny you goods or services, charge you different prices, provide different
        quality of services unless those differences are related to your information, or suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services. 
        RebornRental may refuse a consumer request or charge a reasonable fee to comply with a request if it determines that a
        request is manifestly unfounded or excessive. If RebornRental makes this determination, it will promptly notify you in writing along
        with the reason for its decision. 
    </p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p> We take precautions to protect your information. When you submit sensitive information via the website,
        your information is protected both online and offline. 
        Wherever we collect sensitive information (such as credit card data), that information is encrypted and transmitted to us in a secure way. 
        While we use encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted online,
        we also protect your information offline. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example,
        billing or customer service) are granted access to personally identifiable information.
        The computers/servers in which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment. </p>

    <h2>Links</h2>
    <p>This website contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we are not
    responsible for the content or privacy practices of such other sites.
