        to supervise and direct the operation of the Equipment, including signal persons to direct the Operator. Customer warrants and represents that any signal person(s) and rigger(s) supplied by Customer 
        or Customer’s designee for whom Customer is responsible are qualified as defined by OSHA Regulation, 29 CFR §§ 1926, 1425 & 1428, and that documentation of such qualification is available onsite.

      </li>
       <li>
        <strong>Method of Payment.</strong>
        Unless RebornRental extends credit to Customer as specified herein, RebornRental requires payment for the Initial Charges prior to Equipment delivery.
        Customer gives RebornRental authorization to charge Customer’s credit card for any Additional Rent and/or Additional Charges incurred by Customer.
        If RebornRental elects in its sole discretion to extend credit to the Customer, terms per credit application and approval letter apply (“Credit Terms”).
        RebornRental shall have the right to limit the amount of credit available to Customer and may increase or decrease this limit without notice to any person, including Customer and Guarantor(s). 
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Rental Protection Plan</strong>
        The Rental Protection Plan ("RPP") is not insurance nor is it a warranty. It is an option RebornRental may offer you to limit liability for loss or damage to the Equipment.
        If Customer does not accept RPP, Customer must provide evidence of insurance for rented/leased equipment coverage in accordance with Paragraph 24. The benefit from RPP is 
        limited by the deductible in subparagraph (a) and excludes the specific conditions or events shown in subparagraph (b). (a) If this Contract is in compliance and if RebornRental 
        in its discretion has offered and Customer has accepted, RPP, then RebornRental
        agrees to waive, to the extent specified in this paragraph, Customer's responsibility for damage to the Equipment to the extent that it exceeds a deductible of $1,000 if
        Equipment rented has a value of $25,000 or less or $2,500 if Equipment rented value is greater than $25,000 or 10% of the repair cost plus tax, whichever is less (“Deductible").
        In the event Customer fails to pay Deductible within thirty (30) days of receipt of the damage Invoice, RPP for the Equipment will be considered to be waived by Customer,
        any RPP amount paid by Customer for the Equipment will be applied to the outstanding damage Invoice and Customer will be responsible for all outstanding balance of the Equipment damage Invoice in full.
        RPP can only be accepted prior to the scheduled delivery of the Rental. (b) Notwithstanding Customer's acceptance of RPP, Customer's responsibility for loss or damage will not be limited by subparagraph (a) to the extent 
        such loss or damage results from operator's gross negligence or from: (i) vandalism, malicious mischief, theft, mysterious disappearance or conversion of the Equipment; (ii) striking an overhead object with the Equipment;
        (iii) leaving keys, if any, in the Equipment while that Equipment is not locked or otherwise secured; (iv) exposure to corrosive materials; (v) overloading of a boom or dumpster, or otherwise exceeding rated capacity of the Equipment;
        (vi) loss or damage to motors or other electrical appliance devices caused by artificial current; or (vii) any damages or loss resulting from use of Equipment in violation of any provision of this Contract, violation of any law,
        ordinance or regulation or operation in an improper or negligent manner. In the event any of the above exceptions apply, RPP does not apply, and in that event,
        Customer is obligated to pay RebornRental for costs incurred by RebornRental for the damage. In the event the Equipment is lost, stolen, destroyed, seized by governmental action,
        or in RebornRental opinion, irreparably damaged, Customer shall be responsible for the purchase price of a new piece of equipment of similar kind, in addition to any other damages RebornRental may incur.
        RPP is not insurance and does not protect Customer from liability to RebornRental or others arising out of possession or operation of Equipment, including injury or damage to persons, or property.

      <li>
        <strong>Delivery of Equipment.</strong>

        If after inspection, Customer has a proper objection to Equipment, Customer shall notify RebornRentalimmediately in writing before use of Equipment.
        Customer acknowledges and agrees that should Customer fail to notify RebornRental within the time specified that it will be conclusively presumed that
        Equipment is in good working condition and that Customer is satisfied with and has accepted Equipment for all purposes and waives any right to object to Equipment thereafter.

        Equipment and Customer disclaims any obligation or responsibility of RebornRental to Customer or any operator of Equipment. Equipment will not be used when overloaded, or to carry persons or property for hire;
        (iv) Customer will not allow the use of Equipment in any publication (print, in audiovisual or electronic); (v) Customer will pay for any fees for licenses, registrations, permits, and other certificates that
        may be required for the lawful operation of Equipment; (vi) Customer or its employees and agents will not alter or cover of any decals or insignia on Equipment or remove any operational or safety instructions;

        insurers providing the insurance under this Contract, in the prompt delivery of any Claim or proceeding at law or equity or threat thereof, and the investigation and the defense of any Claim.

        <strong>Limitation of RebornRental Liability and Damages to Customer.</strong>
        To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law and excepting willful misconduct by RebornRental, RebornRental shall not be liable to Customer, and Customer covenants that it shall not assert a claim against RebornRental, under any legal theory, whether in an action based on a contract, breach of warranty, negligence, tort, strict liability, or otherwise provided by statute or law, for any direct or indirect loss, incidental, exemplary, consequential or statutory damages or any damages resulting from lost profits or use of capital, revenue, income or rent, production delays, loss of product, reservoir loss or damage, losses resulting from failure to meet other contractual commitments or deadlines, downtime of facilities, interruption of business, or loss of goodwill, even if RebornRental had been advised of the possibility of such damage, which are caused by, resulting from or in any way connected with the possession, transport, operation, use, control or storage of Equipment of any Rental, including any failure to have Equipment delivered as specified.

CUSTOMER HEREBY WAIVES ANY CLAIM THAT THESE EXCLUSIONS, LIMITATIONS AND WAIVERS DEPRIVE IT OF AN ADEQUATE REMEDY OR CAUSE THIS CONTRACT TO FAIL IN ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. CUSTOMER AND REBORNRENTAL HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT ANY WARRANTY DISCLAIMERS AND LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY PROVISIONS SET FORTH IN THIS CONTRACT HAVE BEEN NEGOTIATED AND ARE FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF THE BASIS OF THIS CONTRACT IN THAT THEY RECOGNIZE THAT REBORNRENTAL DOES NOT OWN EQUIPMENT AND HAS NOT SEEN IT BUT ONLY LOCATES EQUIPMENT AND RENTS IT TO CUSTOMER.
